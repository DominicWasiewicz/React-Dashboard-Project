## Description of Components

### Ecommerce

The dashboard includes many important metrics such as earnings, yearly salaries, sales overview, and recent transactions. This gives the user an organized overview of their financial metrics. Almost all of them are interactive, displaying descriptive information in pop-up windows. Other feeatures include a responsive navigation bar that can be collapsed.  

### Orders

The orders table displays all of the orders that have been made using a pagination system. Each order has a picture of the item, item name, customer name, total amount, status, and order number.

### Employees

The employees table displays all current employees. It includes a completely functional search bar and filter functionality. Each employee has their name, role, country, start date, their manager, and employee ID. 

### Customers

The customers table displays all customers and is fully editable. This means you are able to select multiple rows and delete them or edit each field individually. Each customer has their name, project name, status, time of employment, budget, location, and customer ID displayed.

### Calendar

The calendar application includes a fully functional calendar. The user can create as many events needed which can be dragged and dropped. The user has the ability to make many small edits to each event such as the title, location, start/end time, and many more. The view of the calendar is also adjustable as you can set the view to each day, week, and month. The calendar even has an agenda view for users to choose from.

### Kanban

Kanban is similar to the more commonly known application Trello where users can set up tasks that are divided into three lists. The scheduling system is fully interactive where the user can move each task to whichever list they chose to.
